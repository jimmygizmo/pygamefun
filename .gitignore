# General Customizations and Git-Ignore Template Development

# Zone.identifier files (extended attribute, meta information for image files and maybe anything downloaded) (Windows)
# We would never want these in any repo, so this is a good new general item to add to all .gitignore templates
**/*Zone.Identifier

# Original source for this .gitignore file might have beenGitHub or PyCharm/IntelliJ. I'm not sure and did not inspect
# it closely when making these comments. BUT I do recall it seemed like a NEW and better one to consider as my baseline
# gitignore, which of course I would need to customize a lot. I think below here is all or mostly from that original
# source which if my recollection serves me, was a good updated source as of July 2024.
# TODO: Confirm the above, compare to other recent good sources, continue making my own fresh new gitignore(s) since
#     it has been a few years since I updated my own. (A lot of the time I have just taken the GitHub Python gitignore
#     and made a few adjustments a the top. A few of my full stack projects use a React/Javascript/Node gitignore
#     from GitHub similarly.

# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.
