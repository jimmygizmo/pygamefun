
Some (not all) lingering/challenging false/inaccurate PyCharm (and possibly also MyPy) WARNINGS can sometimes be
related to Numpy Broadcasting, which is allows multiple types to work in certain cases.
PyCharm type inspection and possibly also MyPy may not always be able to figure this out.

I know of other similar problems in which NumPy is not involved, but I have dealt with with the NumPy example.

This is a good doc on that topic:

https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html


When I was working on early version of resizer, I may have had this problem. (Can't recall all the details.) It might
have been when trying to get formats to work with pygame.image.frombytes.
I don't see any lingering warnings, so it might have been in some code that is now gone or disabled.

Regarding the other false type wanings, I'll document those elsewhere but they are where I pass groups to Sprite
creation and it wants Tuple[AbstractGroup... someething...  Unrelate to Numpy.


So, when dealing with this NumPy issue I had cases where things just worked fine even though I was getting the error,
so it was confusing. This link will shed light on the issue. I'll update here when I deal with it again and comment
on some best practices on how to address it.
