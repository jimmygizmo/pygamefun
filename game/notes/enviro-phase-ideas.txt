# Enviro-phase ideas: I want to generalize so I need a tiny macro language to instruct enviro response changes to ANY ATTRIBUTE.
#     This macro system needs to be super simple and process efficiently. Or use callbacks to little functions which
#     implement the enviro responses.
# TODO: Assess how much of a performance impact this is. It does not need to happen on every frame. This could change
#     only at the time the phase changes and the update to speed (or any other attribute) would persist in the instance.
#     I think this needs to be implemented differently and be triggered from the phase change counter if-else in the
#     main loop. Need to figure out the access to the instances from there etc. Maybe we will call this via a separate
#     sprite group method invocation.
